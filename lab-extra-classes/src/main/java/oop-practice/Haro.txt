I live in a low income housing environment that goes by the government name of section 8.
Me and a group of my allies control certain areas of this section to run our illegitimate business.
We poses unregistered firearms, stolen vehicles, mind-altering inhibitors and only use cash or financial purchases.
If anyone would like to settle unfinished altercations, I will be more than happy to release my address.
I would like to warn you, I am a very dangerous person and I regularly disobey the law.
